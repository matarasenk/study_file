  <h2> What makes a superhero?</h2>
  <p>
    A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't.
    So in order to be a superhero,
    <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to
    use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
    <br>
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest
    story.But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good
    guy
    is doing someyhing that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
