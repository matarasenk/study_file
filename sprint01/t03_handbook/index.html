                <h4>&#60;div&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;div&#62; tag is an empty container that is used to define
                a division or a section. It does not affect the content or layout
                and is used to group HTML elements to be styled with CSS or manipulated
                with scripts.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;div&#62;Name&#60;div&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <div>Hello</div>
            </div>
            <div class="elements">
                <h4>&#60;h1&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;h1&#62; to &#60;h6&#62; elements are used to define six levels of HTML
                Headings, with &#60;h1&#62; being the highest (or most important) level
                and &#60;h6&#62; the least important one.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;h1&#62;Title&#60;/h1&#62;

                <h4>&#60;footer&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;footer&#62; tag defines the footer of a web page
                or a section. Usually, it contains copyright information, contact details,
                navigation links, etc.
                You can have several &#60;footer&#62; tags on a web page. For example, you can
                place a footer inside the &#60;article&#62; tag to store information related to
                the article (links, footnotes, etc.).
                The tag can contain other HTML elements, except for the &#60;footer&#62;
                and &#60;header&#62; tags.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;footer&#62;Hello&#60;/footer&#62;

                <h4>&#60;p&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;p&#62; tag defines a paragraph of text.
                It is a block-level element and always starts on a new line.
                Before and after each paragraph, browsers add margin automatically.
                You can modify the margins using the CSS margin property .
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;p&#62;Hello&#60;/p&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>I'm paragraph</p>

                <h4>&#60;blockquote&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;blockquote&#62; tag is used to define long
                quotes inside the document. Browsers usually indent &#60;blockquote&#62; elements.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;blockquote&#62;Hello&#60;/blockquote&#62;

                <h4>&#60;pre&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;pre&#62; is used to insert a preformatted text into an HTML document.
                The spaces and line breaks in the text are preserved. The &#60;pre&#62; tag
                is usually used to display code, or a text (for example, a poem), where
                the author himself sets the location of the lines relative to each other.
                Text in a &#60;pre&#62; element is shown in a fixed-width font.
                The tag content is displayed in the browser in a monospace font.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;pre&#62;Hello&#60;/pre&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <pre>Hello</pre>

            <div class="elements">
                <h4>&#60;hr&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;hr&#62; tag is a block-level element
                transferring all the elements after it to another line.
                The external look of the horizontal line defined by the
                tag depends on the type of the browser. More often it is
                displayed with a border, which creates 3D effect.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;hr/&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <hr>

                <h4>&#60;dd&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;dd&#62; tag, together with
                the &#60;dl&#62; and &#60;dt&#62; tags, is used to create a definition list.
                The &#60;dd&#62; tag contains a description of the term, which is
                defined by the &#60;dt&#62; tag. There should be at a minimum one
                &#60;dt&#62; tag followed by at a minimum one &#60;dd&#62; tag for each group.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;dd&#62;- hot drink&#60;/dd&#62;
                <h4>Example</h4>

            <div class="elements">
                <h4>&#60;a&#62;</h4>
                The &#60;a&#62; tag is used to insert hyperlinks
                to other pages, or files, locations within the same page,
                email addresses, or any different URL. You can use both text
                and image as a hyperlink.
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                &#60;a href="https://google.com/"&#62;Click me&#60;/a&#62;

                    <h4>Domain Name System (DNS)</h4>
                    <p>The domain name system (DNS) gives us humans an easy way to identify where we want to go on the
                        Internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>A domain name is a human-friendly address for a website, something that's easy for us to remember
                        and type in.</p>
                    <h4>Anatomy of a domain name</h4>
                    <p>Each domain name is made up of parts:
                        third-level-domain.second-level-domain.top-level-domain
                        There are a limited set of top level domains (TLDs), and many
                        websites use the most common TLDs,".com", ".org", and ".edu".
                        The third level domain is also called a subdomain, because it's owned by
                        the same group and that URL often directs you to a subset of the website,
                        like "m.wikipedia.org" (mobile-optimized Wikipedia) or "es.khanacademy.org"
                        (Spanish-language Khan Academy).
                    </p>
                    <p>Behind the scenes, each domain name maps to an IP address.
                        When we type a URL in the address bar of our browser, the
                        computer has to figure out its IP address.
                    </p>
                    <p>The computer can't store a database of more than 300 million
                        domain names locally, so it goes through a multi-step process
                        to find out the IP address.

                    <h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h4>
                    <p>Whenever you visit a page on the web, your computer uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                        (HTTP) to download that page from another computer somewhere on the Internet.</p>
                    <p> HTTP is a protocol that's built on top of the TCP/IP protocols.
                        Each HTTP request is inside an IP packet, and each HTTP response is
                        inside another IP packet--or
                        more typically, multiple packets, since the response data can be quite large.</p>
                    <p>There are many other protocols built on top of TCP/IP,
                        like protocols for sending email (SMTP, POP, IMAP) and uploading files (FTP).
                        All of these protocols enable us to use the Internet to connect with
                        other computers in useful ways, and to communicate and collaborate
                        across wide distances.</p>

                    <h4>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h4>
                    <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP,
                        the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website
                        that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'.
                        It means all communications between your browser and the website are
                        encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online
                        transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
                    <p> To understand why HTTPS protocol, we first should know how wi-fi
                        routers function.Let's say you are at an airport and you are connecting
                        to the wi-fi which is the property of a third party. Now, when you are
                        communicating over HTTP, the text is being transferred by their router.
                        And if I go to a low version of the router, I can comfortably check and
                        read the text that is being transferred. There could be a password that
                        I can use to login to your bank site and do a fraudulent transaction!.
                        Point being -
                        this is fundamentally insecure. This is called the man in the middle attack.
                        And this why do we need https when HTTP seems to suffice.
                        Now, to save our data from such attacks, we need to encrypt that data.

                        <li><b>3 types of DNS queries</b> — recursive, iterative, and non-recursive</li>
                        <li><b>3 types of DNS servers</b> — DNS Resolver, DNS Root Server and Authoritative Name Server
                        </li>
                        <li><b>10 types of common DNS records</b> — including A, AAAA, CNAME, MX and NS</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>DNS Types: 10 Top DNS Record Types</h3>
                    <p>DNS servers create a DNS record to provide important information about
                        a domain or hostname, particularly its current IP address. The most common DNS record types are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Address Mapping record (A Record)—also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its
                            corresponding IPv4 address.</li>
                        <li>IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6
                            address.</li>
                        <li>Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)—can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname.
                            When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname,
                            the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname. </li>
                        <li>Mail exchanger record (MX Record)—specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to
                            route outgoing emails to an email server.</li>
                        <li>Name Server records (NS Record)—specifies that a DNS Zone, such as “example.com” is
                            delegated to a specific Authoritative Name Server, and provides the address of the name
                            server. </li>
                        <li>Reverse-lookup Pointer records (PTR Record)—allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address
                            and receive a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).</li>
                        <li>Certificate record (CERT Record)—stores encryption certificates—PKIX, SPKI, PGP, and so on.
                        </li>
                        <li>Service Location (SRV Record)—a service location record, like MX but for other communication
                            protocols.</li>

                            indicates the Authoritative Name Server for the current DNS zone, contact details for the
                            domain administrator, domain serial number, and information on how frequently DNS
                            information for this zone should be refreshed.</li>
